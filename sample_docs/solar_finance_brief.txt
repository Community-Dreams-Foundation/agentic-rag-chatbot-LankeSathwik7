# Solar Storage Pilot Brief

## Main Contribution
The pilot introduced a weekly forecasting loop that combines weather-normalized demand estimates with battery dispatch constraints.
This reduced planning variance by 18 percent compared with the previous quarter.
The team also built a shared dashboard so Finance and Operations used the same assumptions during approval.

## Assumptions
The model assumes stable panel efficiency during each monthly planning cycle.
It also assumes battery degradation remains below 2.5 percent per quarter.
Weather shocks beyond the historical p95 range are treated as exceptions and escalated manually.

## Limitations
The pilot was tested in only two regions, so transferability to high-humidity zones is uncertain.
Manual data handoff from Operations to Finance still introduces delay on Mondays.
