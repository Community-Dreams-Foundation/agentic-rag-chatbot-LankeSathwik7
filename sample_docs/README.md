# Sample Documents

Place 1–3 small documents here for quick local testing.

Guidelines:
- Keep at least one tiny `.txt` file so judges can test quickly.
- You may also include a small PDF if your app supports PDF parsing.

For the challenge, you are encouraged to ingest open-access arXiv PDFs/HTML.

Included in this repo:
- `solar_finance_brief.txt`: planning, assumptions, limitations for citation testing.
- `operations_notes.txt`: workflow learnings + a prompt-injection awareness sentence.
